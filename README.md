# Deadline Desk (formerly Soonlist)

ðŸš§ **This project is currently in development.** ðŸš§

**Your simple deadline list with just the reminders you need..**

Deadline Desk is a minimalist, single-purpose web application designed to do one thing exceptionally well: remind you of upcoming deadlines. Built for users who feel overwhelmed by complex to-do lists and project management software, Deadline Desk provides a clean, single-list view of your tasks, sorted by urgency.

## The Philosophy

In a world of feature-bloated productivity apps, Deadline Desk is an experiment in radical simplicity. The core workflow is designed to be frictionless:

1.  **Add a task** in a single input box.
2.  **Pick a deadline** from a calendar.
3.  **Choose when to be reminded** (1, 3, or 7 days before).

That's it. No multiple lists, no sub-tasks, no priorities, no tags. Just a clear, chronological list of what's next.
